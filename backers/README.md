# Fuzzy user finder

**This script is a snippet at the moment. You'll need to customize it for it to work for you.**

The script uses the command line fuzzy-finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to find a user in a list and prints out its data.

Fzf must be installed and available on the PATH.

With hundreds of backers on the last two GDQuest Kickstarters campaigns, I often get support requests from people who didn't receive an email, lost their coupon code etc. This script is here to make the process faster.
